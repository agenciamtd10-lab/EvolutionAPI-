## Evolution API

Evolution API began as a WhatsApp controller API based on [CodeChat](https://github.com/code-chat-br/whatsapp-api), which in turn implemented the [Baileys](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys) library. While originally focused on WhatsApp, Evolution API has grown into a comprehensive platform supporting multiple messaging services and integrations. We continue to acknowledge CodeChat for laying the groundwork.

Today, Evolution API is not limited to WhatsApp. It integrates with various platforms such as Typebot, Chatwoot, Dify, and OpenAI, offering a broad array of functionalities beyond messaging. Evolution API supports both the Baileys-based WhatsApp API and the official WhatsApp Business API, with upcoming support for Instagram and Messenger.

## Fork Notice

This repository is a self-maintained fork of [EvolutionAPI/evolution-api](https://github.com/EvolutionAPI/evolution-api), continued after upstream development stopped (last upstream release: v2.3.7, December 2025). Maintained by Jean Lima.

## Types of Connections

Evolution API supports multiple types of connections to WhatsApp, enabling flexible and powerful integration options:

- *WhatsApp API - Baileys*:
  - A free API based on WhatsApp Web, leveraging the [Baileys library](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys).
  - This connection type allows control over WhatsApp Web functionalities through a RESTful API, suitable for multi-service chats, service bots, and other WhatsApp-integrated systems.
  - Note: This method relies on the web version of WhatsApp and may have limitations compared to official APIs.

- *WhatsApp Cloud API*:
  - The official API provided by Meta (formerly Facebook).
  - This connection type offers a robust and reliable solution designed for businesses needing higher volumes of messaging and better integration support.
  - The Cloud API supports features such as end-to-end encryption, advanced analytics, and more comprehensive customer service tools.
  - To use this API, you must comply with Meta's policies and potentially pay for usage based on message volume and other factors.
